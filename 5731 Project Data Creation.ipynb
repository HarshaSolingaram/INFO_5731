The contribution of the paper: a new framework called MUST (Multi-user Simulator Training) for training task-oriented dialogue systems. MUST leverages multiple user simulators to train a dialogue system, with the goal of improving the system’s robustness to various user behaviors. The method of the paper: MUST (Multi-user Simulator Training). MUST addresses the challenge of training a dialogue system on a single user simulator, which can lead to the system being over-fitted to that specific simulator and under-fitted to others. MUST accomplishes this by leveraging multiple user simulators simultaneously. The authors propose three ways to implement MUST: MUSTmerging, MUSTCRL, and MUSTuniform. MUSTadaptive is the method ultimately chosen by the authors as it tackles the challenges of balancing exploration and exploitation, and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. MUSTadaptive utilizes an adaptively-updated distribution to select user simulators during training. The dataset used in the paper: didn't find information may have used personal dataset. The findings or conclusions of the paper: that MUST leads to a more robust dialogue system that can perform well with unseen user simulators. The authors propose a framework called MUST that leverages multiple user simulators to train task-oriented dialogue systems. MUST addresses the challenges of over-fitting to specific user simulators and catastrophic forgetting by formulating the problem as a Multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem. Their method, MUSTadaptive, achieves better performance than training with a single user simulator. MUSTadaptive balances adapting to different user simulators and uniformly exploring all simulators during training.

SafeConv provides unsafe spans in an utterance, indicating which words contribute to the detected unsafe behavior, and safe alternative responses to continue the conversation when unsafe behavior is detected. The method of the paper: The authors benchmarked three powerful models for the mitigation of conversational unsafe behavior, including a checker to detect unsafe utterances, a tagger to extract unsafe spans, and a rewriter to convert an unsafe response to a safe version. The dataset used in the paper: The dataset used in this paper is SafeConv, which is constructed by the authors for the research of conversational safety1. The findings or conclusions of the paper: The experiments showed that the detected unsafe behavior could be well explained with unsafe spans and popular chatbots could be detoxified by a huge extent.

The method of the paper: ACLM builds on BART and is optimized on a novel text reconstruction or denoising task - they use selective masking (aided by attention maps) to retain the named entities and certain keywords in the input sentence that provide contextually relevant additional knowledge or hints about the named entities. The dataset used in the paper: The paper does not explicitly mention the dataset used. However, it can be inferred that they used a dataset of complex named entities. The findings or conclusions of the paper: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ACLM both qualitatively and quantitatively on monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual complex NER across various low-resource settings. ACLM outperforms all their neural baselines by a significant margin (1%-36%). In addition, they demonstrate the application of ACLM to other domains that suffer from data scarcity (e.g., biomedical). In practice, ACLM generates more effective and factual augmentations for these domains than prior methods.

       "'Abstract User simulators are agents designed to imitate human users; recent advances have found that Taskoriented Dialogue (ToD) systems optimized toward a user simulator could better satisfy the need of human users. However, this might result in a suboptimal ToD system if it is tailored to only one ad hoc user simulator, since human users can behave differently. In this paper, we propose a framework called MUST1to optimize ToD systems via leveraging Multiple UserSimula Tors. The main challenges of implementing the MUST are 1) how to adaptively determine which user simulator to interact with the ToD system at each optimization step, since the ToD system might be overfitted to some specific user simulators, and simultaneously underfitted to some others; 2) how to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the adaption for a simulator that is not selected for several consecutive optimization steps. To tackle these challenges, we formulate MUST as a Multiarmed bandits (MAB) problem and provide a method called MUST adaptive that balances i) the boosting adaption for adaptive interactions between different user simulators and the ToD system andii) the uniform adaption to avoid the catastrophic forgetting issue. With both automatic evaluations and human evaluations, our experimental results on MultiWOZ show that the dialogue system trained by MUST achieves a better performance than those trained by a single user simulator. It also has a better generalization ability when testing with unseen user simulators. 1 Introduction Taskoriented dialogue systems aim to help users accomplish their various tasks (e.g., restaurant reservations) through natural language conversations. Training taskoriented dialogue systems in 1The code is available at https://github.com/ kiseliu/must .supervised learning approaches often requires a large amount of expertlabeled dialogues, however collecting these dialogues is usually expensive and timeconsuming. Moreover, even with a large amount of dialogue data, some dialogue states may not be explored sufficiently for dialogue systems2 (Li et al., 2016b). To this end, many researchers try to build user simulators to mimic human users for generating reasonable and natural conversations. By using a user simulator and sampling user goals, we can train the dialogue system from scratch with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Previous works tend to design better user simulator models (Schatzmann et al., 2007; Asri et al., 2016; Gur et al., 2018; Kreyssig et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021). Especially, Shi et al. (2019) builds various user simulators and analyzes the behavior of each user simulator in the popular restaurant search task from MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018). In real scenarios, dialogue systems need to face various types of users. A single ad hoc user simulator can only represent one or a group of users, while other users might be underrepresented. Instead of choosing the bestperforming one from many dialogue systems trained by different single user simulators, we believe that it is worth trying to train a dialogue system by leveraging all user simulators simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a framework called MUST to utilize Multiple UserSimula Tors simultaneously to obtain a better system agent. There exist several simple ways to implement the MUST framework, including a merging strategy, a continual reinforcement learning (CRL) strategy, and a uniform adaption strategy, namely MUST merging , MUST CRL, and MUST uniform respectively (See §3.2). However, none of them could effectively tackle the challenges: 1) how to efficiently leverage multiple user simulators to train the dialogue 2We use the dialogue systems to refer to the taskoriented dialogue systems for simplicity in this paper.1system since the system might be easily overfitted to some specific user simulators and simultaneously underfitted to some others, and 2) it should avoid a catastrophic forgetting issue. To tackle them effectively, we first formulate the problem as a Multiarmed bandits (MAB) problem (Auer et al., 2002); similar to the exploitation vs exploration tradeoff, specifying multiple user simulators should trade off a boosting adaption (tackling challenge 1) and a uniform adaption (tackling challenge 2), see §4.1 for more details. Then we implement a new method called MUST adaptive to utilize an adaptivelyupdated distribution among all user simulators to sample them when training the dialogue system in the RL training. Our contributions are threefold: (1) To the best of our knowledge, our proposed MUST is the first developed work to improve the dialogue system by using multiple user simulators simultaneously; (2) We design several ways to implement the MUST. Especially, we formulate MUST as a Multiarmed bandits (MAB) problem, based on which we provide a novel method MUST adaptive ; and (3) The results show that dialogue systems trained with MUST consistently outperform those trained with a single user simulator through automatic and human evaluations, showing its potential for robustness to the diversity of user simulators. Importantly, it significantly improves the performance of the dialogue system tested on outof-domain evaluation. Moreover, our results show that our method MUST adaptive can efficiently leverage multiple user simulators to train the dialogue system in terms of convergence speed. 2 Background Dialogue system. Taskoriented dialogue systems aim to help users accomplish various tasks such as restaurant reservations through natural language conversations. Researchers usually divide the taskoriented dialogue systems into four modules (Wen et al., 2017; Ham et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021): Natural Language Understanding (NLU) (Liu and Lane, 2016) that first comprehends user’s intents and extracts the slotsvalues pairs, Dialog State Tracker (DST) (Williams et al., 2013) that tracks the values of slots, Dialog Policy Learning (POL) (Peng et al., 2017, 2018) that decides the dialog actions, and Natural Language Generation (NLG) (Wen et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020) that translates the dialog actions into a naturallanguageform. The DST module and the POL module usually are collectively referred to as the dialogue manager (DM) (Chen et al., 2017). These different modules can be trained independently or jointly in an endto-end manner (Wen et al., 2017; Liu and Lane, 2018; Ham et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021). User simulator. The user simulator is also an agent but plays a user role. Different from dialogue systems, the user agent has a goal describing a target entity (e.g., a restaurant at a specific location) and should express its goal completely in an organized way by interacting with the system agent (Takanobu et al., 2020). Therefore, besides the modules of NLU, DM, and NLG like dialogue systems, the user agent should have another module called Goal Generator (Kreyssig et al., 2018), which is responsible for generating the user’s goal. Building a user simulator could usually use an agendabased approach (Schatzmann et al., 2007; Schatzmann and Young, 2009) designing handcrafted rules to mimic user behaviors or a modelbased approach such as neural networks (Asri et al., 2016; Kreyssig et al., 2018; Gur et al., 2018) learned on a corpus of dialogues. Training dialogue systems with a user simulator. To start a dialogue, a user agent will have an initial goal from its Goal Generator and then expresses its goal in natural languages. However, users’ goals are invisible to the system agent. Then the system agent tends to gradually understand the users’ utterances, query the database to find entities, and provide useful information to accomplish users’ task. When the database result returned by the system agent is empty, the user agent should learn to compromise and change its goal with the help of Goal Generator. When the dialogue ends, the user simulator will reward the system agent according to if it accomplishes the task. Then we could use the reward to update the system agent with RL algorithms (Tseng et al., 2021). 3 MUST: a Framework to Leverage Multiple User SimulaTors 3.1 Motivations to Use Multiple Simulators User simulators behave differently. Shi et al. (2019) implement six user simulators (AgenT, AgenR, AgenG, RNNT, RNNR, RNN3) with both 3Here we rename the user simulators of SLT, SLR, and SLE in Shi et al. (2019) as RNNT, RNNR, RNN for emphasizing the model structure of their DM modules.2(a) Success rates of different systems. (b) Dialog act distributions of different user simulators. Figure 1: (a) is the heat map on the success rates of system agents tested by different user simulators on 200 dialogues. (b) shows the dialog act distributions of Agendabased User Simulators (ABUS) and Neural networksbased User Simulators (NUS) provided by Shi et al. (2019). There exist seven user dialog acts annotated in the restaurant search task from MultiWOZ, as shown on the Yaxis. agendabased methods and neural networksbased methods on the popular restaurant search task from MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018). From their experiments, we observed that the dialogue systems trained by different user simulators vary in their performances (i.e., the success rates tested by the same user simulators). For example, when interacting with the user simulator of AgenT, the success rates of the system agents trained by Agendabased user simulators (i.e., AgenT, AgenR, AgenG) are much higher than those of the system agents trained by RNNbased user simulators (i.e., RNNT, RNNR, RNN), see Fig. 1(a). The reason might be that these user simulators (i.e., with either handcrafted rules or datadriven learning in their DM modules) have different user dialog act distributions4(see Fig. 1(b)) which determine the dialogue state space explored by the dialogue system. One cannot stand for everyone. Users might behave differently, one could design different user simulators with specific user dialog act distributions, see Shi et al. (2019). A single user simulator learned on a taskoriented dialogue corpus can just represent one or a group of users, while the dialogue system needs to accomplish tasks from various human users in real scenarios. We argue that it is beneficial to utilize all different user simulators to train the dialogue system. By leveraging multiple user simulators that have different user dialog act distributions, the dialogue systems can explore a larger dialogue state space, which might 4The dialogue policy learning module is essential in both dialogue systems and user simulators. A policy module corresponds to a dialog act distribution since it decides to take which dialog act to respond to the current dialogue state. The user dialog act distribution behind a user simulator determines the diversity of the dialogue state space explored by dialogue systems; therefore it might affect the system performances.improve the ability of the learned dialogue system. 3.2 Some Preliminary Proposals for MUST We propose a framework called MUST, the core idea of which is to train a better dialogue system by leveraging Multiple UserSimula Tors simultaneously. There are several simple ways to implement our MUST, including a merging strategy (MUST merging ), aContinual Reinforcement Learningstrategy (MUST CRL), and a uniform adaption strategy (MUST uniform ). (I) MUST merging first samples some dialogues from each user simulator and the corresponding dialogue system trained by this simulator. Then it combines the collected dialogues to train a new user simulator for ensembling different user dialog act distributions. Finally, it uses this new user simulator to train the dialogue system with RL. (II) MUST CRL5treats each user simulator as an independent RL environment. It moves the trained system agent to another one (i.e., let the system agent interact with another user simulator) if the system has converged in the current environment. (III) MUST uniform allows the system agent have chances to interact with all user simulators simultaneously. Different from MUST CRL, MUST uniform puts all user simulators in a single RL environment and adopts the simplest way to specify different user simulators to train the dialogue system, which is to pick a user simulator among all user simulators with a uniform distribution for each iteration in the RL training. 5Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) (Khetarpal et al., 2020) is a sequential learning paradigm for training an agent with RL algorithms.3dynamic avoiding forgettingefficiencyadaption catastrophic MUST merging × × × MUST CRL × × × MUST uniform × ✓ × MUST adaptive ✓ ✓ ✓ Table 1: The comparison of different strategies for leveraging multiple user simulators. Challenges to leverage multiple user simulators. It is difficult to adaptively adjust weights of user simulators during training in MUST merging . Since the proportions of dialogues from each user simulator are fixed in MUST merging , user simulators might be welladapted and others might not. The MUST CRL strategy has a problem of catastrophic forgetting (Khetarpal et al., 2020) and would be sensitive to the order of different user agents interacting with the dialogue system, which might result in obtaining a suboptimal dialogue system. As Shi et al. (2019) shows, the system agents trained by different user simulators have different convergence speeds and converged performances. Namely, the system agent might be easily fitted to some user simulators but might be hardly fitted to others. A uniform distribution for the simulator selection under MUST uniform will result in inefficient training, since it would be unnecessary to assign the many training costs for easilyadapted user simulators. Overall, the challenging problems under MUST are 1) how to efficiently leverage multiple user simulators to train the system agent, and 2) avoiding the catastrophic forgetting issue. 4 MUST as a MAB Problem To tackle the challenges in MUST, we first formulate MUST as a Multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, see §4.1. In §4.2, we propose a method called MUST adaptive to use an adaptivelyupdated distribution to replace the uniform distribution under the MUST uniform for accelerating the MUST training. We briefly compare these different implementations of MUST in Tab. 1. 4.1 Formulating MUST as a MAB Problem Adaptively specifying user simulators to train dialogue systems reminds us of a similar concept in machine learning, called boosting (Zhou, 2012). From a boosting point of view, one should increase the weights of weaklyperforming data examples and decrease the weights for wellperforming ones.In MUST, we accordingly assume that it should reduce the interactions between the dialogue system and those user simulators that the system has performed well; and meanwhile increase the interactions between the system and other user simulators that the system performs poorly. We refer to this strategy as boosting adaption . Meanwhile, we should also give some chances to all user simulators to relieve the catastrophic forgetting issue. We refer to this as uniform adaption . Such a tradeoff between boosting adaption and uniform adaption is similar to the the exploitation vs exploration tradeoff existing in the Multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem (Auer et al., 2002). Here, we interpret MUST as a MAB problem. We treat each user simulator as an arm. Suppose there are Karms (simulators), and each arm ihas a fixed but unknown reward distribution Riwith an expectation µi. At each time step t= 1,2, ..., T , one must choose one of these Karms. We denote the arm pulled at time step tasit∈ {1, ..., K}. After pulling an arm, it receives a reward xitdrawn from the arm’s underlying reward distribution. The decision maker’s objective is to maximize the cumulative expected reward over the time horizon T/summationdisplay t=1E[xit] =T/summationdisplay t=1µit. (1) In MUST, the reward received in each armpulling step refers to the possible performance gain of the dialogue system after it interacts with a selected user simulator. A significant difference between the standard MAB problem and MUST is that the reward expectation of a user simulator (arm) in MUST is not static; it changes over time. For example, by consecutively interacting with the same user simulator, the performance gain (reward) of the system will decay since the system might be in saturation or overfitting to this simulator. Moreover, the performance gain of the system after interacting with a simulator might increase if the simulator has not been selected for a period. To deal with this difference , we should tailor the solution of MAB to the MUST framework. 4.2 Training with MUST adaptive To solve this MAB problem in MUST, we implement a method called MUST adaptive with a twophase procedure, as presented in Algorithm 1. MUST adaptive specifies user simulators in a4Algorithm 1: Implement MUST adaptive with the modified UCB1 algorithm Input: K fixed User simulators U={U1, U2,···UK}and the values of hyperparameters Twarmup, T, e, d, τ ; 1Initialization : randomly initialize System agent S; 2Initialization : initialize the simulator sampling distribution pas a uniform distribution. 3(1)Warmup phase: 4fort= 0, ..., T warmup−1do 5 sample a simulator UjinUw.r.t. the distribution p; 6 synthesize a new dialogue using the system agent Sand the sampled Uj; 7 use the reward obtained for the dialogue to update Swith a RL algorithm; 8(2)Adaptive phase: 9fort= 0, ..., T−1do 10 ift%e== 0 then 11 forj= 1, ..., K do 12 evaluate the performance i.e. the success rate ¯xjof the agent Sby letting it interact dtimes with the simulator Uj; 13 update pbased on these success rates {¯x1, ...,¯xK}(see Eq. 2, Eq. 3, and Eq. 4); 14 else 15 sample a simulator UjinUw.r.t. the distribution p; 16 synthesizing a new dialogue using the system agent Sand the sampled Uj; 17 use the reward obtained for the dialogue to update Swith a RL algorithm; Output: The learned dialogue system S. uniform distribution, similar to the UCB16algorithm, to train the dialogue system Sin the first Twarmup steps (i.e., in the warmup phase ). After that, the adaptive phase will balance the boosting adaption and the uniform adaption by introducing an adaptivelyupdated distribution p, which is used to specify different user simulators to train the systemSin later RL training. To accelerate the RL training, intuitively, pis expected to assign lower weights to user simulators with which Salready performs well andhigher weights to those user simulators with which Sperforms poorly . (1) Warmup phase : in the first Twarmup dialogues, we use a uniform distribution to sample all user simulators to train the system agent S(lines 47). This phase is mainly used to warm up the dialogue system S. (2) Adaptive phase : the distribution pused to sample all user simulators will be adaptively updated. We call it as the adaptive phase . When this phase begins (i.e., t= 0), we will first evaluate the performance (i.e., the success rate ¯xj, j∈ {1,···, K}) of the dialogue system Strained after the warmup phase . The success rate ¯xjis obtained by letting Sinteract dtimes with the simulator Uj(e.g., j∈ {1, ..., K}) and calculating the 6There exists an algorithm called UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound 1 ) (Auer et al., 2002) that could solve the MAB problem. It first pulls each arm once in the first Ksteps, then will play the arm that could maximize the sum of two terms: it= arg max i/parenleft\\uf8ecig ¯xi+/radical\\uf8ecig 2 lnt Ti,t/parenright\\uf8ecig fromt=K+ 1toT.success rates. Inspired by UCB1 (Auer et al., 2002), we design a calibrated performance expectation ˆxjof the system agent Sinteracting with each user simulator Ujtaking exploration into consideration beyond pure exploitation: ˆxj= ¯xj/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright exploitation+/radical\\uf8ecigg 2 lnt Tj,t /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright exploration, j∈ {1, ..., K};(2) where ¯xjis the success rate of the system agent S tested with user simulator Uj, and Tj,tis the number of times user simulator Ujhas been selected with so far. Then we normalize ˆxjinto zj= 1/(ˆxj−τmin({¯x1,···,¯xK})), (3) Eq. 3 penalizes the user simulators with which the dialogue system already performs well in the expectation term. Where the hyperparameter τis the smooth factor for distribution p={p1,···,pK} – the larger τis, the sharper pis. Each probability pjinpis calculated as pj=zj/summationtextK i=1zi. (4) In the following T−1dialogues, we will specify all user simulators to train the system agent S with this distribution p(lines 1518). We will also evaluate the RL model Sfor every eepisodes (line 1012) and update the distribution pwith the new Ksuccess rates (line 13). Difference with the original UCB1. The main differences between our modified UCB1 algorithm5and the original UCB1 algorithm are twofold. First, we tailor the original UCB1 into our scenario by using Eq. 3 to penalize the user simulators with which the dialogue system has performed well. Secondly, we adopt a sampling schema based on a welldesigned distribution (see Eq. 4) instead of taking the arm with the highest expectation. This is to increase the diversity and flexibility of arm selection. 5 Experiments To verify the effectiveness of MUST, we benchmark the system agents trained either with a single user simulator or multiple user simulators (including MUST merging , MUST uniform , and MUST adaptive ). See MUST CRL in the App. C. 5.1 Experimental Setup Available user simulators. There are six user simulators provided by Shi et al. (2019), which are AgendaTemplate ( AgenT ), AgendaRetrieval (AgenR ), AgendaGeneration ( AgenG ), RNNTemplate ( RNNT ), RNNRetrieval ( RNNR ), RNNEnd2End ( RNN ) trained with different dialog planning and generation methods. The NLU modules of all six user simulators are using the RNN model. The DM modules of AgenT ,AgenR , and AgenG are rulebased methods. For the NLG module, these three simulators are using the template, retrieval, and generation methods respectively. The DM modules of RNNT , and RNNR are using Sequicity (Lei et al., 2018) as their backbones which is an RNNbased seq2seq model with copy mechanism. The NLG modules of these two simulators are using the template and retrieval methods respectively. The user simulator of RNN uses Sequicity as its backbone in an endto-end manner. Baselines. The baselines are the dialogue systems trained by each user simulator, including SysAgenT ,SysAgenR ,SysAgenG ,SysRNNT ,SysRNNR , and SysRNN . For a fair comparison, all system agents (including the systems trained by our MUST) have the same architecture described in Shi et al. (2019). See details in App. B.1. MultiWOZ Restaurant Domain Dataset. The original task in MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018) is to model the system response. Shi et al. (2019) annotate the user intents and the userside dialog acts in the restaurant domain of MultiWOZ to build user simulators, which has a total of 1,310 dialogues. Moreover, we randomly simulate 2,000 dialogues from each rulebased simulator (i.e., AgenT, AgenR, AgenG) and their corresponding system agents respectively, and processe these dialogues to have the same annotation format as the MultiWOZ restaurant domain dataset. We denote this dataset asSimulated Agenda Dataset , which has a total of 6,000 dialogues. Evaluation Measures. A straightforward metric to evaluate dialogue systems is the success rate tested by each user simulator. We calculate the success rate between a user simulator and a system agent by sampling 200 dialogues. We exclude some user simulators in training MUST and test the systems with them as outof-domain evaluation . According to the previous study Gunasekara et al. (2020), there usually is a gap between automatic evaluations and human evaluations of dialogue systems. Therefore, we ask humans to converse with dialogue systems. Each dialogue system has conversed with 5 different users; each user has 10 dialogues. In total, we collect 50 dialogues for each dialogue system to calculate its success rate. See more details in App. B.5. 5.2 Implementations 5.2.1 Two new User Simulators We believe Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) might improve the capacity of user simulators since they have recently shown remarkable success in building taskoriented dialogue systems (Ham et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; HosseiniAsl et al., 2020). Here we implement another two user simulators using GPT (Radford et al., 2018, 2019). Building a user simulator using GPT is similar to building a ToD system with GPT. See more details in App. G. GPT Simulator. It is first finetuned on the simulated agenda dataset and then finetuned on the MultiWOZ restaurant domain dataset by leveraging GPT. This user simulator will be used to help implementing MUST. GPT IL Simulator. To implement the MUST merging strategy, similar to Imitation Learning (IL), we first train a new user simulator with dialogue sessions collected from different user simulators and their corresponding dialogue systems. We also learn this new user simulator based on GPT model and denote it as GPT IL. GPT ILis first finetuned on the simulated agenda dataset . Then we sample 1,400 dialogues from the6Dialogue SystemsIndomain evaluation Outof-domain evaluation All AgenT AgenR RNNT GPT AgenG RNNR RNN Avg. ↑Std.↓Avg.↑Std.↓ singleSysAgenT 97.5 54.0↓40.0%98.5↓0.5%78.0↓4.9% 72.5 92.5 77.0 80.7 8.6 81.4 14.8 SysAgenR 96.0↓1.5%90.0 98.5↓0.5%80.5↓1.8% 97.5 97.5 82.0 92.3 7.3 91.7 7.1 SysRNNT 30.5↓68.7%23.0↓74.4%99.0 75.5↓7.9% 35.5 97.5 84.0 72.3 26.6 63.6 30.5 SysGPT 60.5↓37.9%51.5↓42.8%97.0↓2.0%82.0 59.5 94.0 92.0 81.8 15.8 76.6 17.6 MUSTSysMUST merging 97.5↑0.0% 83.5↓7.2%94.5↓4.6%80.5↓1.8% 97.5 94.0 82.5 91.3 6.4 90.0 6.9 SysMUST uniform 97.5↑0.0% 89.0↓1.0%97.5↓1.5%82.5↑0.5% 96.5 96.0 87.5 93.4 4.2 92.4 5.6 SysMUST adaptive 97.5↑0.0% 89.5↓0.5%97.0↓2.0%82.5↑0.5% 96.5 97.5 90.0 94.7 3.3 92.9 5.3 [1] The underlined number represents the success rate between a user simulator and its corresponding dialogue system trained by this user simulator.

We use four simulators (AgenT, AgenR, RNNT, and GPT) to implement MUST uniform and MUST adaptive . simulated agenda dataset and merge them with 1,310 MultiWOZ restaurant domain dialogues to continue finetuning GPT IL. 5.2.2 Dialogue Systems SysGPT is trained with the single user simulator GPT. SysMUST merging is trained with GPT IL. SysMUST uniform is trained by the user simulators of AgenT, AgenR, RNNT, and GPT with a uniform sampling distribution. For training SysMUST adaptive7, the distribution pwill be adaptively updated using our modified UCB1 algorithm. We also train the SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive by using different subsets of the user simulators for ablation studies in App. D. 5.3 Experimental Results Automatic Evaluation. As seen in Tab. 2, SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive outperform the dialogue systems (SysAgenT, SysAgenR, SysRNNT, and SysGPT) trained by a single user simulator in the overall performance, demonstrating the superiority of leveraging multiple user simulators. Especially, SysMUST adaptive has a 1.2 absolute value improvement (92.9 vs. 91.7) averagely over the previous SOTA system SysAgenR. Observing that SysMUST merging is not as competitive as SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive , this comparison shows that the merging strategy cannot effectively leverage multiple user simulators. Inindomain evaluation , the performances of systems (SysAgenT, SysAgenR, SysRNNT, and SysGPT) trained by a single user simulator drop a lot when testing with a different simulator. It requires us to delicately select a suitable user simula7See implementations of dialogue systems in App. B.2 and policy gradient algorithm in App. B.3.Dialogue Systemshuman evaluation singleSysAgenT 76.0 SysAgenR 84.0 SysRNNT 34.0 SysGPT 58.0 MUSTSysMUST merging 90.0 SysMUST uniform 92.0 SysMUST adaptive 92.0 Table 3: Human evaluation. tor for obtaining a good dialogue system. However, users might be multifacet or even unknown, making the selection even more difficult. Therefore, it is essential to leverage multiple user simulators when training dialogue systems. At least, the performance gap of dialogue systems trained with our MUST becomes smaller than without MUST, see the percentages labeled in green and red colors. Inoutof-domain evaluation where the user simulators used for testing the systems are unseen by our MUST, SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive achieve at most 2.4 absolute value improvement over SysAgenR. This evidences that MUST has a better generalization ability for interacting with unseen user simulators. Moreover, the dialogue systems (SysMUST merging , SysMUST uniform , and SysMUST adaptive ) trained with the proposed MUST approaches have lower standard deviations, which indicates that they are more robust to the diversity of user simulators. Human Evaluation. In Tab. 3, the human evaluation results show that our SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive largely outperform the other dialogue systems when interacting with real users. The consistency between automatic evaluations and human evaluations evidences the effectiveness of our proposed MUST.7(a) The learning curves (b) AgenR (c) AgenT (d) GPT (e) RNNT Figure 2: The learning curves of SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive .

Figure 3: The sampling proportions of user simulators in average (a) and in time horizon (b). 5.4 Analysis and Discussions Convergences of MUST uniform and MUST adaptive .In Fig. 2, we show the learning curves of SysMUST uniform and SysMUST adaptive in 100,000 steps; the first 40,000 steps are in the warmup phase for SysMUST adaptive . From Fig. 2(a), we can see that training the dialogue system with AgenT, AgenR, RNNT, and GPT by MUST adaptive converges faster than by MUST uniform . We do ablation studies on our modified UCB1 algorithm to help understanding the designed distribution p, see details in App. E. We further plot the performances of the dialogue system tested by each user simulator in the RL training in Fig. 2(b)-2(e). Visualization on MUST adaptive .Let us define the adaptation difficulty of a user simulator using how many steps it must take to train the dialogue system with this user simulator until it converges. The adaptation difficulty of all user simulators could be ranked like AgenR >AgenT >GPT>RNNT according to Fig. 2(b)-2(e). To check whether MUST adaptive tends to sample harderto-adapt user simulators more times in the adaptive phase , as assumed in §4.2, we visualize the sampling proportions of alluser simulators in Fig. 3(a). We could observe that AgenR was sampled with 45.1% (the biggest proportion) and it is indeed the hardest user simulator that can be adapted by the system; RNNT has the smallest sampling proportion and it is the easiest user simulator that can be adapted by the system. The consistency between the adaptation difficulty and sampling proportions for these four user simulators evidences our assumption in §4.2. Fig. 3(b) visualizes the variations of the sampling distributions of user simulators. Interestingly, it shows that AgenR and AgenT are competitive with the GPT simulator; while RNNT and GPT are cooperative with each other. This might be because both RNNT and GPT simulators are learned from the dialogue corpus and might share some similar behaviors. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a framework named MUST to improve dialogue systems by using multiple user simulators simultaneously. We discuss several simple methods to implement MUST, which is either inflexible or inefficient. Therefore, we formulate MUST as a Multiarmed bandits (MAB) problem, based on which we propose a novel implementation called MUST adaptive . The experimental results on the restaurant search task from8MultiWOZ demonstrate that MUST can largely improve the system agent upon baselines, especially when tested with unseen user simulators. Moreover, MUST adaptive is more efficient than other implementations. Limitation The main limitation of this work is that we only conduct our experiments on the restaurant domain of the MultiWOZ since we can only find multiple user simulators from Shi et al. (2019) and they build these simulators only on the restaurant search task. In future work, we plan to apply our proposed methods to multidomain scenarios.

However, this might result in a suboptimal ToD system if it is tailored to only one ad hoc user simulator, since human users can behave differently. In this paper, we propose a framework called MUST1to optimize ToD systems via leveraging Multiple UserSimula Tors. The main challenges of implementing the MUST are 1) how to adaptively determine which user simulator to interact with the ToD system at each optimization step, since the ToD system might be overfitted to some specific user simulators, and simultaneously underfitted to some others; 2) how to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the adaption for a simulator that is not selected for several consecutive optimization steps. To tackle these challenges, we formulate MUST as a Multiarmed bandits (MAB) problem and provide a method called MUST adaptive that balances i) the boosting adaption for adaptive interactions between different user simulators and the ToD system andii) the uniform adaption to avoid the catastrophic forgetting issue. With both automatic evaluations and human evaluations, our experimental results on MultiWOZ show that the dialogue system trained by MUST achieves a better performance than those trained by a single user simulator. It also has a better generalization ability when testing with unseen user simulators. 1Introduction Taskoriented dialogue systems aim to help users accomplish their various tasks (e.g., restaurant reservations) through natural language conversations. Training taskoriented dialogue systems in 1The code is available at https://github.com/ kiseliu/must .supervised learning approaches often requires a large amount of expertlabeled dialogues, however collecting these dialogues is usually expensive and timeconsuming. Moreover, even with a large amount of dialogue data, some dialogue states may not be explored sufficiently for dialogue systems2'"
